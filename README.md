## What's here
This project contains tasks from openedu Data Storage and Processing course.
Implemented with numpy, pandas and matplotlib. 
This is basically my first dive into _scientific_ python so feel free to comment.

## Notes  
I'm not sure I can share data in `data` folder so it might disappear one day  
Also I'm not sure it's not gonna change in the future.
